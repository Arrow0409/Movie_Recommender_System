# Movie_Recommender_System

Objective:
Designed and implemented a movie recommendation system, integrating a user-friendly interface using Streamlit as the frontend and Flask as the backend. The system provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences.

Key Steps:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gathered movie datasets and preprocessed them for model input.
Collaborative Filtering Model:

Implemented collaborative filtering techniques, leveraging user-item interactions for personalized recommendations.
Model Evaluation:

Assessed the recommendation model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and precision.
Streamlit Frontend:

Created an interactive and visually appealing frontend using Streamlit to facilitate user input and display movie recommendations.
Flask Backend:

Developed a Flask backend to handle communication between the frontend and recommendation model.
Deployment on Heroku:

Deployed the recommendation system on Render, ensuring accessibility to users.
User Interface Enhancement:

Implemented features in Streamlit for dynamic user interactions, enhancing the overall user experience.
Testing and Optimization:

Conducted rigorous testing to ensure the system's robustness and optimized performance.
Results:
The movie recommendation system provides users with tailored movie suggestions through a user-friendly interface. Deployed on Heroku, the system seamlessly integrates Streamlit's dynamic frontend and Flask's backend for a responsive and interactive experience.

Note:
This project showcases expertise in recommendation systems, model deployment, and web development, combining machine learning with frontend and backend technologies.
